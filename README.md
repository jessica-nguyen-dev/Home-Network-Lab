## Multi-Site-Network-Simulation
This project involves designing and configuring a multi-site network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes the setup of routers, switches, servers, and PCs across three sites, with a focus on efficient network management. I implemented IP addressing, subnetting, DHCP, and RIP routing to ensure seamless communication between sites. Additionally, I optimized network performance using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and validated the setup with diagnostic tools like ping and tracert for troubleshooting and performance verification.

## Status
This project is currently in progress and is expected to be completed by the end of December!
