# Home-Network-Lab
Networking home lab project designed to explore and apply fundamental networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project involves simulating and troubleshooting various network configurations, including setting up and testing TCP/IP communication, implementing VLANs for network segmentation, and verifying device connectivity and interoperability. The project serves as a hands-on environment for me to build practical networking skills and experiment with different configurations to understand real-world scenarios.

## Status
This project is currently in progress and is expected to be completed by the end of December!
